== Description ==

= The Simple Way to Backup Your Site =
WP Backitup creates a backup zip of your site&apos;s content and configuration in just a single click, 
right from your Wordpress dashboard. There is no need to FTP into your site and no knowledge of MySQL or PHPMyAdmin is required. You can use your backup zip to restore your site or to clone a site&apos;s content and settings when setting up a new one.

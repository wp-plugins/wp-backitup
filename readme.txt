= Don't Risk Losing Your Website =
Does the thought of losing your website keep you up at night? All the time, effort and money you've invested, gone in an instant.  Wordpress is an incredible product but there are many things that can cause you to lose your website.  You could get hacked, your hosting company could go out of business, you could install a bad plugin or theme, the list is endless and without good backups, you could lose everything. If this isn't one of the things keeping you up at night, then it really should be. It was keeping us up at night so we decided to do something about it.

In 2012 we created the WP BackItUp plugin and made it freely available to the Wordpress community so that we can all sleep better at night knowing our content is safe.

We want to make Wordpress backups as **simple**, **effective** and **easy** as possible because we don’t want anything to stop you from backing up your Wordpress site regularly.  We offer this plugin to you for free so that you will **BackItUp** and sleep better at night.
